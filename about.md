Akihiro Isomura received his B.S. degree mainly in Physics from Kyoto University (2003) and Dr. of Science degree from Kyoto University (2009). After one year stay at Institute for Integrate Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), Kyoto University, he joined Ryoichiro Kageyama group as a postdoc. Since 2015, he is working as a PRESTO researcher.

His major research interest is nonlinear dynamics in biological systems. Presently, he is studying ultradian oscillators from the view point of nonlinear physics and optogenetic tools for the spatiotemporal control of gene expression dynamics.
